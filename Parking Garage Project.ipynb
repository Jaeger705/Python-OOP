    "Your assignment for today is to create a parking garage class to get more familiar with Object Oriented Programming(OOP). \n",
    "\n",
    "Your parking gargage class should have the following methods:\n",
    "- takeTicket\n",
    "   - This should decrease the amount of tickets available by 1\n",
    "   - This should decrease the amount of parkingSpaces available by 1\n",
    "- payForParking\n",
    "   - Display an input that waits for an amount from the user and store it in a variable\n",
    "   - If the payment variable is not empty then ->  display a message to the user that their ticket has been paid and they have 15mins to leave\n",
    "   - This should update the \"currentTicket\" dictionary key \"paid\" to True\n",
    "-leaveGarage\n",
    "   - If the ticket has been paid, display a message of \"Thank You, have a nice day\"\n",
    "   - If the ticket has not been paid, display an input prompt for payment\n",
    "      - Once paid, display message \"Thank you, have a nice day!\"\n",
    "   - Update parkingSpaces list to increase by 1\n",
    "   - Update tickets list to increase by 1\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need a few attributes as well:\n",
    "- tickets -> list\n",
    "- parkingSpaces -> list\n",
    "- currentTicket -> dictionary"
